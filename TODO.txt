1. Hold down right click with an item in the mouse to add 1 to a cell automatically. This will allow you to slide the mouse over multiple cells to add 1 to each one without having
to let go and press right click multiple times. Need to make sure this does not continuously add +1 to a cell many times if you are holding down.

3. Add a max stack quantity (maybe 100?) - this needs to be accounted for in several places in the logic

4. Add crafting recipes and output

    - Shift right click output moves to next open slot in inventory or next slot with same item (try to re-use moveCraftingToInventory() logic)
    - Left click ouput picks up, can do multiple times
